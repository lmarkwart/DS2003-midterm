# DS2003-midterm
Lauren Markwart DS2003 midterm project
In my midterm project, I am creating a database to hold information about police use of violent force that resulted in the death of an individual in the United States in 2015. I imported several CSV files into MySQL in order to create tables in the database to logically separate the information. After importing, I created secordary fact tables that allow for the information about the various events to be viewed in conjunction with one another. I developed various SELECT statements to query different information from my database and summarize data. I also used python toto interact with a no SQL database in MongoDB.
